# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the  **longest**   **substring**  without duplicate characters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        set<char> st;

        int left = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {

            while (st.find(s[right]) != st.end()) {
                st.erase(s[left]);
                left++;
            }

            st.insert(s[right]);

            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
